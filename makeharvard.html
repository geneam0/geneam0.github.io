                <p>
                  Interested in tackling on another project, I decided to go to MakeHarvard, a make-a-thon for engineers.
                  I assembled a team through Facebook, consisting of Ryan (an MBA student at Harvard), Zachary (a biomedical engineer at GeorgiaTech), and Lagan (another biomedical engineer from the University of Waterloo).
                  Together, we brainstormed on a few ideas and chose to produce a VR medical device. 
                  We were tackling the issue of White Coat Hypertension, a phenomenon in which patients exhibit higher blood levels in a clinical setting solely due to the stress and anxiety of being in the setting.
                  Our solution was a VR device that both relaxes the patient while gathering biometric data like their heart rate, temperature, humidity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On the day of the Make-a-thon, there were technical problems with getting our supplies. 
                  We requested a bunch of electronic parts for the sensors twice, but the online request never got to the team at MakeHarvard.
                  Already facing issues, we simplified our product to just two sensors, which Ryan acquired by going to an electronics store.
                  Meanwhile, Lagan and I worked on the software for the VR project, gathering relaxing views for the medical device.
                  When Ryan got back, he and Zach worked on the electronics.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although the beginning was stressful, we were able to get a lot done once we got into the swing of things.
                  An issue we encountered was getting the bluetooth module to communicate with the VR device. 
                  The solutions we found online required that we buy SDKs or required specific bluetooth modules that we didn't have.
                  Our work-around was to record the data onto an SD card, and develop on the bluetooth in a future installment.
                  Afterall, all you need is the data.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What surprised me from this experience was how supportive every "maker" was.
                  Being my first make-a-thon, I was worried I wouldn't have enough experience or skills to have a meaningful impact.
                  However, my research in IoT sensors and high school days of making Unity games matched the skillset of this project.
                  My team was also super supportive and we complimented each other almost perfectly.
                  Ryan, being the project manager, facilitated the organization of our work, along with developing the elevator pitch.
                  Lagan used her artistic and video creating abilities to improve the aesthetics of our presentation, and worked with me on the VR software. Here's our <a href="assets/img/makeharvard/MEDitate logo.png" style=color:#448fff>logo</a>, which she drew up.
                  Zach worked on a farming robot project in his freshman year and contributed to the hardware. 
                  I also received help and inspiration from the rest of the participants at MakeHarvard.
                  Here is an <a href="assets/img/makeharvard/cool.mp4" style=color:#448fff>awesome project</a> someone did that I would like to make in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the end, we didn't win, but the team is currently working on making it into a startup.
                  Although I commited to an internship in robotics, the rest of team MEDitate is working on a telemedicine device that builds off our work at MakeHarvard.
