                <h3>DC Motor</h3>
                <p>
                  Despite my game programming background and entering college as a Computer Science major, I never saw myself as a software developer. 
                  I enjoyed programming, but wanted to apply it to electronics.
                  After exploring Engineering 101, I knew I wanted to pivot my career and pursue Computer Engineering.
                </p>
                <p> 
                  My professor for the class, albeit old-fashioned, gave us a ton of exciting electrical projects to inspire our impressionable minds: radios, <a href="assets/img/circuits/speaker.mp4" style=color:#448fff>speakers</a>, a record player, microphones. 
                  I had so much fun.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our final project was a simple DC motor that wasn't so simple. 
                  The theory behind it is pretty simple. When current flows through a winding wire, it induces a magnetic field powerful enough to generate torque. 
                  A motor uses this principle to rotate and spin. 
                  Heres a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAtPHANEfQo" style=color:#448fff>video</a> that explains the physics behind it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Physics is ideal, almost too optimistic at times. 
                  Actually applying the theory and building the project... not so much. 
                  Our first mistake happened with the wiring of the motor.
                  The direction you wind the wires affects the direction that current flows and affects the direction of the magnetic field. 
                  Here's a video of me testing the polarity of the field magnets and armature magnets:
                </p>
                <video width="600" height="328" controls>
                  <source src="assets/img/circuits/motornowork.mov" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                <p>
                  After we got the write polarity on the magnets, our motor still would not spin. 
                  We worked on the motor for several weeks, rebuilding the motor at least three times. 
                  Sometimes, there wasn't enough wiring. Other times, there was too much glue layered between the copper plate and wire. 
                  We even spoke to the lab technician and he theorized it was the brushes. 
                  We were using copper brushes so he suggested we tried aluminum, aka the paper clip.
                  It was really a conglomerate of all these factors that prevented our motor from spinning.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The day the project was due, our motor still would not work despite all our attempts. 
                  Thankfully, our professor - clairvoyant and omniscient - helped us fix our motor. 
                  He skinned off the excessive glue layer that meddled with the commutator plates. 
                  He also exposed more wiring and thus, more current to the battery. 
                  He finally got our motor to work by ramping up the voltage of the car battery to 20V.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Success! Here is a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QTtoNLBX1fQqGXoVlQXq2w0qFkgf-B_gHoSAVGLTE68/edit?usp=sharing" style=color:#448fff>link</a> to the report I wrote up with nice drawings.

                <h3>Digital Clock</h3>
                <p>
                  This section of the blog post is an update to the original, and written one year after Engineering 101.
                  The year is 2020 and the coronavirus forced CCNY to operate online through Zoom.
                  Despite COVID-19 messing up the schedule of our labs, I got to build our final - the digital clock - at home.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since all my finals ended, this was a relaxing project for me. 
                  I crimped wires and connected them to logic gates while watching my first K-drama.
                  At times, I would pause my show to troubleshoot - read the manual and schematic of the integrated circuits.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Looking back, I'm happy I decided to pursue engineering. 
                  As an engineer, I feel in-control of the problem at hand and I'm supplied with the knowledge to deal with it.
                  My fingers were tired from crimping at the end of the day, but I continued to try different methods if my clock displayed the wrong numbers.
                  Since I started the project early, I was also able to help my peers troubleshoot their clocks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A note to my future self: continue to pursue activites that give life meaning, that make your day worthwhile.
