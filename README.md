## Customization

It's your website, and you control the source code. So you can customize everything, if you like. But we've provided a handful of quick customizations for you to consider as you get your website off the ground.

## Adding pages

To **add a page** to your website (e.g. detailed resume):

1. Create a new `.html` or `.md` file at the root of your repository.
2. Give it a filename that you want to be used in the page's URL (e.g. `http://yoursite.dev/filename`).
3. At the start of your file, include the following [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/):

```
---
layout: default
---
```

## Adding blog posts

To **add a blog post** to your website:

1. Create a new `.md` file in your repository's `/_posts/` directory.
2. Give it a filename using the following format:

```
YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP
```

3. At the start of your file, include the following [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/):

```
---
title: "The title of my blog post"
---
```

Your website comes with a placeholder blog post that you can reference. Notably, its [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) declares `published` as `false`, so that it won't appear on your website.

While you can define a `layout` in the front matter, your website is pre-configured to assign the `post` layout to all of the posts in your `/_posts/` directory. So you don't have to declare that in your posts.

Jekyll's conventions for authoring and managing blog posts is very flexible. You can [learn more in Jekyll's documentation for "Posts."](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/)


### Layouts

Your repository comes with three layouts:

- **default**: Not used by any of the built-in pages or posts, but useful for any new pages you create.
- **home**: Used by your `index.html` homepage to display listings of your projects, interests, and (optionally) your blog posts.
- **post**: Used by default by the posts in your `/_posts/` directory.

Jekyll's convention for defining layouts is very flexible. You can [learn more about customizing your layouts in the Jekyll "Layouts" docs.](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/layouts/)
