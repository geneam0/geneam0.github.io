                  I took Game Programming after AP Computer Science A. 
                  The class mostly consisted of seniors, dealing with college applications so Ms. Qiu tried to make the class fun and relaxing, giving us creative projects.
                  Throughout the year, we embarked on low-risk VR projects, multiplayer games, 2D, 3D, etc. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  We used the Unity game engine, which at first, I disliked for its clunky UI and long-rendering times.
                  The software is much easier to use now, but back then, I wasn't sure if the software was being too slow or if I was doing something wrong. 
                  To make matters worse, the school computers were much too old to handle Unity so I brought my laptop to school everyday, instead.
                  When October came around, I finally got used to Unity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I have three projects to showcase from that class.

                <p>
                  GeneEatsPizza is a project I started working on at AtomHacks 2017.
                  Originally, I was a volunteer for the event, but I was inspired to put my face in a Unity game. 
                  With a Youtube tutorial and my phone, I was able to record a gif and upload it to Unity.
                  And after weeks of building onto it, I presented it for our 2D infinite runner unit.
                  Out of all my Unity projects, I have the most affection for this one.

                <h3>Spaceship Galactica</h3>
                <iframe src="https://itch.io/embed/664332" height="177" width="552" frameborder="0"><a href="https://genelam.itch.io/spaceship-galactica">Spaceship Galactica by genelam</a></iframe>
                <p>
                  The title is a work in progress.
                  Originally, I titled it "Battlestar Galactica" and commended myself for the creative, yet smooth-like-butter name.
                  It was too good to be true that I looked online and yup, it was already a classic sci-fi series.
                  I must admit, there aren't many titles that deal with space and battle that aren't already taken (ie Star Wars).
                  For now, I settled on Spaceship Galactica and hopefully, I won't get copyrighted.
                  This game was originally meant to be a multiplayer game, and I believe I was able to get a second ship running, somehow.
                  However, the online version is only single-player. Enjoy!

                <h3>Car Maze Game</h3>
                <iframe src="https://itch.io/embed/664371" height="167" width="552" frameborder="0"><a href="https://genelam.itch.io/car-maze">Car Maze Game by genelam</a></iframe>
                <p>
                  As you can see, I'm not good at naming things.
                  I had no idea what to name this game so I called it "Car Maze Game."
                  This game was for our Halloween-haunted maze unit. 
                  Credits go to <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/82-procedural-generation-of-mazes-with-unity" style=color:#448fff>Joseph Hocking</a> for the maze generation tutorial.
                  I added brick textures to the walls, monsters, a glowing ball, and a car. 
                  The goal is for you to navigate the car to the glowing ball without touching the monsters.
                  I think it would have been cool if I programmed the monsters to move in a 3D-pacman style race game.
                  Still, the current version is neat as the maze is randomly generated. 
                  Be sure not to press SPACE or the maze generates itself again.
                  I included it to make debugging easier, but forgot to take the feature out.
